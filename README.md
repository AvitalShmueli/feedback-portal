# Feedback Portal

The Feedback Portal is a web application built using React and Vite that allows users to create a new feedback form associated with a specific package and view feedback from an existing form. The application is built to provide a seamless user experience with a clean interface for both creating the feedback form and reviewing its responses.

## Features

- **Feedback Form Creation**: Users can create a new feedback-form through a user-friendly form.
- **Feedbacks Overview**: A dashboard that displays all submitted feedbacks, allowing users to review and analyze feedback data using various filters.
- **Disable/Enable Feedback Form**: Users can disable or enable an existing feedback-form. Only one feedback form can be enabled at a time for a package.
